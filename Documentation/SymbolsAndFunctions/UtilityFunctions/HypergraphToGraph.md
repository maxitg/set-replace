# HypergraphToGraph

**`HypergraphToGraph`** converts a hypergraph to a [`Graph`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Graph.html) object. There are (currently) 3 ways to perform this transformation:

## **"DirectedDistancePreserving"**

<<<<<<< HEAD
Converts a hypergraph to a directed graph with the same distance matrix, where distance between two vertices `v1` and `v2` in a hypergraph is defined as the minimum length of a path which connects `v1` and `v2` (i.e. 1 if both vertices belong to the same hyperedge):

  VertexLabels -> Automatic,

```

## **"UndirectedDistancePreserving"**

<<<<<<< HEAD
Converts a hypergraph to an undirected graph with the same distance matrix, that is, each hyperedge is mapped to a complete subgraph:

## **"StructurePreserving"**

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
Converts a hypergraph to a graph by preserving its structure. This is achieved by a one-to-one correspondance between vertices and hyperedges in the hypergraph and 2 different kind of vertices - `{"Hyperedge", hyperedgeIndex_, vertexIndex_}` and `{"Vertex", vertexName_}` - in the graph:

It is important to mention that this conversion does not lose any information, and it is possible to unambiguously retrieve the original hypergraph from the resulting [`Graph`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Graph.html):

```wl
fromStructurePreserving[graph_Graph] := Values @ KeySort @ Join[
  GroupBy[Sort @ EdgeList[graph, DirectedEdge[_, {"Vertex", _}]], #[[1, 2]] & -> (#[[2, 2]] &)],
  AssociationMap[{} &, VertexList[graph, {"Hyperedge", _, 0}][[All, 2]]]]

In[]:= {{x, x, y, z}, {}, {z, w}} === fromStructurePreserving @ HypergraphToGraph[
  {{x, x, y, z}, {}, {z, w}}, "StructurePreserving"]
Out[]= True
```
