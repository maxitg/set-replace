# Events and States

**`"EventsStatesList"`** just produces a list of `{event, state}` pairs, where state is the complete state right after this event is applied. Events are the same as generated by [`"AllEventsList"`](Events.md), and the states are represented as edge indices as in [`"AllEventsStatesEdgeIndicesList"`](StatesAsEdgeIndices.md):

```wl
In[] := WolframModel[{{1, 2}} -> {{3, 4}, {3, 1}, {4, 1}, {2, 4}},
 {{1, 1}}, 2, "EventsStatesList"]
Out[] = {{{1, {1} -> {2, 3, 4, 5}}, {2, 3, 4, 5}},
 {{1, {2} -> {6, 7, 8, 9}}, {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}},
 {{1, {3} -> {10, 11, 12, 13}}, {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}},
 {{1, {4} -> {14, 15, 16, 17}},
  {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}},
 {{1, {5} -> {18, 19, 20, 21}},
  {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21}}}
```
