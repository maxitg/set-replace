# GenerateSingleHistory

**`GenerateSingleHistory`** generates single histories, which it achieves by setting
[`MaxDestroyerEvents`](MaxDestroyerEvents.md) to one. Note that for nondeterministic systems, the history generated may
depend on the event order.

For example, for a [`MultisetSubstitutionSystem`](/Documentation/Systems/MultisetSubstitutionSystem.md):

```wl
In[] := multihistory = GenerateSingleHistory[
  MultisetSubstitutionSystem[{a_, b_} :> {a + b, a - b, a * b}], {1, 2}, MaxEvents -> 10]
```

```wl
In[] := #["ExpressionsEventsGraph", VertexLabels -> Placed[Automatic, After]] & @
  SetReplaceTypeConvert[WolframModelEvolutionObject] @ multihistory
```

Note that single histories are not necessarily single-path systems. Multiple rewriting events can be possible starting
from a given state. However, only one event can take any given token as an input, ensuring that all generated events do
not conflict with each other (i.e., there are no branchlike-separated events).
